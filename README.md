# Hi, I'm Anna! 👋

I'm a backend developer driven by the desire to build digital solutions that make people's lives easier. There's nothing quite like seeing a product I've built solve real problems and help users get through their day more smoothly. (And yes, I do get excited about clean code and refactoring along the way!)

## 🎓 Background
I bring a unique dual-competency perspective to tech:
- Lead Developer with experience in team management
- Software Design (2015) - Where I learned to craft efficient, user-focused solutions
- MSc in Global Management (NEOMA Business School) - Where I gained the strategic business insight to bridge technical and business needs

## 💡 What Drives Me
- Creating applications that solve real-world problems
- Bridging the gap between technical teams and users
- Leading development teams and nurturing talent
- Making complex technical concepts accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- Building products that make a real difference in people's daily work

## 🛠 Current Projects
I'm working on a coworking space management application with Symfony 7, where I get to:
- Solve real organizational challenges
- Create intuitive backend solutions
- Build features that make a difference

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Core:** PHP, Symfony
- **Testing:** PHPUnit
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Learning:** DevOps practices

## 🌱 Growth Areas
Currently expanding my knowledge in:
- DevOps methodologies
- Team leadership and management
- Building collaborative developer environments

## 👥 Community Engagement
I'm actively involved in making tech more inclusive and diverse:
- Member of Ladies of Code Paris
- Member of Women in Tech DACH

## 📚 Beyond Code
When I'm not coding or leading teams, you'll find me:
- Lost in fantasy and sci-fi worlds (books, movies, you name it!)
- Discussing feminist perspectives in tech and beyond
- Creating spaces for meaningful conversations
- Exploring ways to make tech more inclusive and accessible
