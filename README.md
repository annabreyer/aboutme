# Hi, I'm Anna! 👋

I'm a backend developer driven by the desire to build digital solutions that make people's lives easier. There's nothing quite like seeing a product I've built solve real problems and help users get through their day more smoothly. (And yes, I do get excited about clean code and refactoring along the way!)

- Creating applications that solve real-world problems
- Bridging the gap between technical teams and users
- Leading development teams and nurturing talent
- Making complex technical concepts accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- Building products that make a real difference in people's daily work

## 🛠 Current Projects
